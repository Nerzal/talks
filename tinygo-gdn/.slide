## About me
- 28 years old
- ~3 years of Go
- GameDev & Microcontroller dev


## TinyGo

What is it about?! (hint below)

## DemoTime
1. start the server
2. open page in browser
3. showcase 
4. don't forget to open the dev tools!
5. oh and please explain some things, while you are at it!

## Agenda
- What is TinyGo?
- Tell me about the features!
- How do you work with interfaces like GPIO, SPI etc?
- WASM

## What is TinyGo?
- Go for small places (Microcontroller)
- Go for WASM (WebAssembly)
- A new compiler for Go written in Go that makes use of the LLVM compiler toolchain

## Some numbers
- Currently 62 microcontroller boards are supported
    - Arduino Uno
    - Ardafruit Feather M0
    - Nintendo Switch
    - [https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo)
- Currently 65 devices are supported
    - BMP280 temperature/barometer sensor (I2C)
    - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance sensor (GPIO)
    - ST7735 TFT display (SPI)
    - [https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers)

## Code Size
.code code/hello-world/main.go

## Code Size #2
.image assets/comparison-size.png 
.caption main compiled with Go vs main-tiny compiled with TinyGo

- 0,04 Megabyte when compiled with TinyGo
- 1,21 Megabyte when compiled with Go

## Tell me about the features!

## Language support
.code code/goroutines/main.go

## Channels
.code code/channels/main.go

## So?
- TinyGo supports a big subset of Go
    - Slices, Channels, Interfaces, Goroutines, defer, Garbage Collection
- WASM/WASI

## What is not working?
- Not every Go program can be compiled yet
- Not every function of every go std package is fully implemented
- Reflection has been reimplemented
- JSON 
    - Serialization & Deserialization that relies on reflection in general

## Is my microcontroller (fully) supported?

## How do you work with interfaces like GPIO, SPI etc?

## Blinky
.code code/blinky/main.go

[https://tinygo.org/docs/tutorials/blinky/](https://tinygo.org/docs/tutorials/blinky/)

## Flashing
Set the target board and pass the path to the main

    tinygo flash --target=arduino-nano33 tinygo/code/blinky/main.go

Reminder: Don't forget to prove that this is working

## The TinyGo Playground

## Libraries?


## Do I have to implement everything on my own?!
**No**

## TinyGo got you covered

## WASM

## Whats that?

"WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications."
[https://webassembly.org/](https://webassembly.org/)

## Why TinyGo?!

.caption Binary size comparison of Go and TinyGo

The Go compiled binary is 30 times the size of the TinyGo compiled binary!

## Home automation dashboard

Goals:

1. Control LED strips 
    1. Turn on/off
    1. Change color
1. Turn on coffee machine

## The architecture
.image assets/HomeAutomation.png _ 600
.caption Architecture of the project


## The server
.code code/dashboard/server

## Interesting files
1. index.html
1. wasm.js
1. wasm_exec.js
1. wasm.wasm

## index.html
.code code/dashboard/index.html

## wasm.js
Initialize the wasm environment

.code code/dashboard/wasmjs

## wasm_exec.js
So called glue code. Implements the syscall/js api

.code code/dashboard/wasm_exec

## wasm.wasm
Compiled wasm binary

.code code/dashboard/wasm

## wasm.go 

.code code/dashboard/wasm.go

## tinydom

1. TinyGo compatible DOM manipulation library
1. Wraps syscall/js
1. Custom types to provide a nice API

## tinydom custom types

.image assets/tinydom-types.png _ 800
.caption Screenshot of the implemented custom types

## Get in touch with TinyGo
1. Follow [@TinyGolang](https://twitter.com/TinyGolang) on Twitter
1. Join the #tinygo channel on the [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com) 
1. Follow [https://www.twitch.tv/lapipatv](https://www.twitch.tv/lapipatv) where [deadprogram (Ron Evans)](https://twitter.com/deadprogram) hacks on microcontrollers
1. Visit [https://tinygo.org](https://tinygo.org), which recently has been completely revamped


We are there to help you out :) 

## I wrote a book <3 
.image assets/B16555_MockupCover.jpg _ 400

## What do you learn?
1. How to setup TinyGo + IDE
