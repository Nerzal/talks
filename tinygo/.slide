## TinyGo

- Find the documentation here: https://tinygo.org/

## Agenda
- What is TinyGo?
- Tell me about the features!
- How do you with interfaces like GPIO, SPI etc?
- 

## What is TinyGo?
- Go for small places (Microcontroller)
- Go for WASM (WebAssembly)
- A new compiler based on LLVM

## Some numbers
- Currently 62 microcontroller boards are supported
    - Arduino Uno
    - Ardafruit Feather M0
    - Nintendo Switch
    - https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo
- Currently 65 devices are supported
    - BMP280 temperature/barometer sensor (I2C)
    - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance sensor (GPIO)
    - ST7735 TFT display (SPI)
    - https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers

## Code Size
.code code/hello-world/main.go

## Code Size #2

.caption main compiled with Go vs main-tiny compiled with TinyGo

- 0,04 Megabyte when compiled with TinyGo
- 1,21 Megabyte when compiled with Go

## Tell me about the features!

## Language support
.code code/goroutines/main.go

## Channels
.code code/channels/main.go

## So?
- TinyGo supports a big subset of Go
    - Slices, Channels, Interfaces, Goroutines, defer
- WASM/WASI targets with some exceptions
    - Garbage collection

## What is not working?
- Not every Go program can be compiled yet
- Not every function of every go std package is fully implemented
- Reflection has been reimplemented
- JSON 
    - Serialization & Deserialization that relies on reflection in general

## How do you with interfaces like GPIO, SPI etc?

## Blinky
.code code/blinky/main.go

## Flashing
Set the target board and pass the path to the main

    tinygo flash --target=arduino-nano33 tinygo/code/blinky/main.go



## Libraries?


## Do i have to implement everything on my own?!
No

## TinyGo got you covered

## Get in touch with TinyGo
1. Follow @TinyGolang on Twitter
1. Join the #tinygo channel on the gophers slack

We are there to help you out :) 

## I wrote a book <3

## What do you learn?
1. How to setup TinyGo + IDE
1. Basics of microcontroller development
1. GPIO/SPI/I2C etc. 
1. How to write your own drivers
1. How to use WiFi and send data over the network
1. How to build web apps using WASM

## Where can u get it?

Basically at every bookstore.
