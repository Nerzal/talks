- Find the documentation here: https://tinygo.org/

## Agenda
- What is TinyGo?
- Tell me about the features!
- 
- Creative DIY Microcontroller Projects with TinyGo and Webassembly

## What is TinyGo?
- Go for small places (Microcontroller)
- Go for WASM (WebAssembly)
- A new compiler based on LLVM

## Some numbers
- Currently 62 microcontroller boards are supported
    - Arduino Uno
    - Ardafruit Feather M0
    - Nintendo Switch
    - https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo
- Currently 65 devices are supported
    - BMP280 temperature/barometer sensor (I2C)
    - HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance sensor (GPIO)
    - ST7735 TFT display (SPI)

## Code Size
.code code/hello-world/main.go

## Code Size #2

.caption main compiled with Go vs main-tiny compiled with TinyGo

- 0,04 Megabyte when compiled with TinyGo
- 1,21 Megabyte when compiled with Go

## Tell me about the features!

## Language support
- TinyGo supports a big subset of Go
    - Slices, Channels, Interfaces, Goroutines, defer
- WASM/WASI targets with some exceptions
    - Garbage collection

## What is not working?
- Not every Go program can be compiled yet
- Not every function of every go std package is fully implemented
- Reflection has been reimplemented
- JSON


## Libraries?
