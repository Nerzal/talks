## Agenda

- What is TinyGo?

## What is TinyGo?

1. A new compiler
2. A new implementation of the Go std libraries

## New compiler benefits

## Hello World

.play code/hello/main.go

## Comparison

go build -o go-hello code/hello/main.go 

> -rwxrwxr-x  1 tobias tobias 1157998 Okt 21 20:06 go-hello

tinygo build --target=arduino -gc=none -o tinygo-hello.hex code/hello/main.go 

> -rw-rw-r--  1 tobias tobias    1332 Okt 21 20:07 tinygo-hello.hex

## New std library benefits

1. Packages are optimized for microcontrollers
2. The machine package

## The machine package

1. Implemented per microcontroller board
2. Offers constants for pins
3. Offers access to all interfaces on a microcontroller board

## Downsides

Not everything is implemented yet.
